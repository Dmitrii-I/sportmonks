Notes
=====

If you want to redact the API-token completely in the logging, you need to make some changes to urllib3.
You need to change lines in `connectionpool.py`. Replace the lines:

.. code-block:: python
    log.debug("%s://%s:%s \"%s %s %s\" %s %s", self.scheme, self.host, self.port,
          method, url, http_version, httplib_response.status,
          httplib_response.length)

with:
.. code-block:: python
    redacted_url = re.sub(r"(api_token=).*(&)", r"\1API_TOKEN_REDACTED\2", url)

    log.debug("%s://%s:%s \"%s %s %s\" %s %s", self.scheme, self.host, self.port,
              method, redacted_url, http_version, httplib_response.status,
              httplib_response.length)
