# Contributing to `sportmonks`

Contributions are appreciated. Significant changes should be first discussed by opening an issue.

## Code formatting
The integrations tests, unit-tests, and package code should be formatted with `black --line-length 120` (`black` is a Python code formatting tool https://github.com/psf/black).

## Tests
All code should be tested with unit tests and integration tests.

## Commit messages
Commit messages should consist of one line summary (<51 chars), and an optional new line and a multi-line description (<73 chars). The summary line should always start with a verb in present tense, e.g. "Add", "Adjust", "Refactor out". First letter should be capitalized.
